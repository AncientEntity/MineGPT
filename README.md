# MineGPT

Release is for 1.18.2. Should compile to 1.19.x.

Take a book and quill, write what you want to happen in minecraft, and then name it "gpt". The plugin will generate the necessary command block code then execute it for you.

By default the plugin only looks at the first page of any book.

Example Prompts To Try:
1. When an arrow is stuck on the ground spawn a primed tnt and after that remove the arrow
2. Kill all entities within a 3 block radius of any arrow except for players and arrows.
3. Remove all blocks around all arrows in a radius 3 sphere and replace it with air. Don't destroy the arrow.
4. Remove all blocks around all players in a radius 3 sphere and replace it with air
5. Every tick summon a bat at an arrow
6. When any player holds a diamond, put a diamond block below them.
7. Change all grass to netherrack in a radius around any player. Change all water to lava in a radius around any player. Change all dirt to netherrack in a radius around any player. Change all sand and stone to soul sand in a radius around any player.
